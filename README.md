Problem Statement- Implement a Fragment that displays a list of items &amp; exposes event handlers when the user selects an item.

Static library support version of the framework's ListFragment. 
Used to write apps that run on platforms prior to Android 3.0.
When running on Android 3.0 or above,
this implementation is still used.

One of the most common issues Android developers face is market fragmentation:
the variations in screen size and pixel density among the thousands of phones, tablets, and even desktop computers that run Android.
The Fragments API (introduced in Android 3.0) helps you deal with this issue.
